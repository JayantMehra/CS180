## CS 180: Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity

These are all the homework problem sets for UCLA's Algorithms course, CS 180, as taught by professor Majid Sarrafzadeh in Fall 2018.

I got the following scores on the problem sets:

| Problem Set   | Score         |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Homework 1    | 58/60         |
| Homework 2    | 59/60         |
| Homework 3    | 55/60         |
| Homework 4    | 58/60         |
| Homework 5    | 60/60         |
| Homework 6    | 60/60         |
